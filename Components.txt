SDN Elements
*Paved the way to scripting "Programming the Network"*

User              - you
     V
Northbound Int   - relay information between the controller and the applications and policy engines 
     V  - Meraki/vManage Dashboard, RESTCONF
SDN Controller    - the core element of an SDN architecture, that enables centralized management and control, automation, and policy enforcement across physical and virtual network environments
     V
Southbound Int   - relay information between the controller and the individual network devices
     V  - Openflow, NETCONF, OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database), SNMP, Meraki (proprietary device‑to‑cloud protocol)
Net Devices       - routers, switches, firewalls, etc.,
